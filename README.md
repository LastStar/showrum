# showrum

Presentation for Contemporary Frontend Development course on CULS 2016.

Developed with [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) and [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), which particulary is an overkill. But learn or die, you know.

## Development and whatever

You need [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [Boot](http://boot-clj.com).

When setup, just run `boot dev` to run development server. Or `boot prod` to build production version.

Have fun!
