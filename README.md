# showrum

Presentation for everyone.

Developed with [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) and [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) which in particular is an overkill. But learn or die, you know.

The production build can be found on [GitHub Page](https://pepe.github.io/showrum/) and you can try sample presentation from [Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pepe/6e7bccf290551c6f540c0eae6d2ca3ab/raw/3d16c5e19834a3e19fc0439f1eeb3739cda55677/decks.md). Hope it works, if not create an issue.

## Development and whatever

You need [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [Boot](http://boot-clj.com).

When setup, just run `boot dev` to run development server. Or `boot prod` to build production version.

Then head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), supply the link to the your gist with Markdown (or use [a sample](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pepe/6e7bccf290551c6f540c0eae6d2ca3ab/raw/e72c2ebcc78c4b8caa8dab98fc3e5025d526cdd7/decks.md)) and you should be set.

Have fun!
