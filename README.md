# showrum

Multidecks presentation.

Developed with [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) and [Potok](https://github.com/funcool/potok).

The production build can be found on [GitHub Page](https://laststar.github.io/showrum/) without the presentation or [with my presentation](https://laststar.github.io/showrum/#/presentation/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL3BlcGUvY3Vscy1iYWNrZW5kLXN1bW1lci0yMDE4L21hc3Rlci9wcmVzZW50YXRpb24ubWQ%3D/1/1) and you can see sample presentation from [Gist of my class presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pepe/culs-backend-summer-2018/master/presentation.md). Hope it works, if not create an issue.

## Development and whatever

You need [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [Boot](http://boot-clj.com).

When setup, just run `boot dev` to run development server. Or `boot prod` to build production version.

Then head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), supply the link to the your gist with Markdown (or use [a sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pepe/culs-backend-summer-2018/master/presentation.md)) and you should be set.

Have fun!
